## About me
When I was very young (~10 years old), I started disassembling and reassembling my computer, I put a new wind on it regularly. I don't know why, but it seemed right and cool to me:) Even then I felt that everything related to computers was my passion. Growing up (19 years old), I went into SEO and worked there for 6+ years. I liked my job, but I lacked the pragmatism in it: wrote - it worked. Who knows SEO will understand what I mean:) So I came to the decision to become a programmer. This is my goal. No matter how hard it is - for me it's a challenge.
